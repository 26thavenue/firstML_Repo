## My first Machine Learning Project 

 Might use tensor flow but basically using python libraries like numpy, sci-kit learn and pandas

 List of Projects I might work on :
 House Prediction
 Heart rate failure 

Might work on some neural network and computer vision , just basically documenting my journey
